            <ul>
                <li>Find a scenario where the same person says "it was the" or "it wasn't the" twice.</li>
                <li>If that scenario is found put the 2 cards referrenced into a suspects list</li>
                <li>Put the remaining cards into the innocent list</li>
                <li><img src="lists.png" alt="Arrays"/></li>
                <li>If a card is in the innocent list we are able to determine if an accusation is now a Truth/Lie.</li>
                <li>If a card is in the suspect list we mark those accusations as Not Sure.</li>
                <li>Since each person tells 1 truth and 1 lie we are able to fillin</li>
                <li>Every accusation we've set to truth or lie we've stored that solution as well as the solution to the contradicting accusation.</li>
                <li>We then go through all the accusations and check if a solution exists for each one.</li>
                <li>Finally the table should be mostly filled out it will go through and check for an accusation being set to "Lie"" and having the prefix of "It wasn't the" or an accusation being set to "Truth"" and the prefix "it was the".</li>
                <li>If this doesn't find a card it moves on to strategy 2</li>
