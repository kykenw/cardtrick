This is a one truth one lie game that demonstrates an algorithm solving a problem.

With a regular deck of cards(52 cards no joker) have someone pick a card.</br>
Show that card to everyone.</br>
Everyone should now tell one truth and one lie referrencing any card in the deck.</br>
(example): "it was the ace of spades"</br>
(example): "it wasn't the queen of clubs"</br>

Onces everyone has told one truth and one lie the table gets generated displaying everyone's accusations.
