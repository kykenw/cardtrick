This is a one truth one lie game that demonstrates an algorithm solving a problem.

With a regular deck of cards(52 cards no joker) have someone pick a card.
Show that card to everyone.
Everyone should now tell one truth and one lie referrencing any card in the deck.
(example): "it was the ace of spaces"
(example): "it wasn't the queen of clubs"

Onces everyone has told one truth and one lie the table gets generated displaying everyones accusations.
